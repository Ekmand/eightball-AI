## Why is this a thing?
The eightball AI started as a joke between Me (Ethan/Ekmand) and my friend Brian as we were traversing through the endless plains of utah thinking of randomness on our drive back home. "What if there was an online version of the classic eight ball?" brain asked. That question sparked a journey like no other. We spent a lot of time looking for a quality online 8 ball but all we could find were half baked implementations. Nothing quite like the experience we had imagined. That's why this is a thing. A cross between the classic 8 ball and the interface of an AI assistant from today. The mystical power of the eight ball merged with the power of digital. Now you can truly ask 8 ball anything. 

## features that I would like to add in the future
Home assistant integration. How great would it be to ask "turn off my living room lights" and get the response `concentrate and ask again`?
